If you aren\u2019t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost 300 baht for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day. I must say that this js for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from 2pm until about 2am then this place is perfect for you.

Self service for extras like fresh fruit/ toast etc. Oh! Why can't  hotels in Thailand get faster toasters? Nui, the customer service lady ( I think) was exceptional. She seemed to make a point of scurrying around at breakfast greeting guests and making sure they were happy, and she always remembered my name! My room was on the first floor and was well appointed and very comfortable. Beach at the hotel was well kept and clean. Plenty of sunbeds and a nice beach side bar. Good hotel with very good and pleasant staff and far enough away from Chaweng nightlife and noise to be able to get a good night's sleep."},

My room was on the first floor and was well appointed and very comfortable. Beach at the hotel was well kept and clean. Plenty of sunbeds and a nice beach side bar.

Pool,a dj everyday at 2pm, three excellent restaurants, amazing staff servers and bartenders! If you aren\u2019t staying at ark bar its the place where everyone goes but it does cost 300 baht for outsiders to enjoy the property for the day. I must say that this js for sure a party resort so if you are okay with the night life party music from 2pm until about 2am then this place is perfect for you. Wednesdays and Friday nights they have their famous beach party which is awesome and during the day on wednesdays and fridays at the pool they have a free buffet at 4 as long as you purchase a drink! I cant say enough good things about this place and I will definitely be back!"},

This was financially better for us to do. We also settled with the feet in the sand at the neighbors enjoyed the 'happy hour'. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel offers assistance with transport, activities and more. The breakfast is good. We were very satisfied with what we got for our money. We stayed in October, as far as we are concerned, a wonderful quiet period to stay in Thailand. The location was perfect! In short, we enjoyed it."},

On the check-in they just say that it's a temporary problem and will be fixed soon - but it never happens. So if you need internet during your stay - avoid this hotel.\rThe next thing is water. If you like to take a shower - there will be so poor water pressure, that you can't wash at all.\rThe beach. If you want to swim in the sea - avoid this hotel. There is a smelly river right near the hotel's beach and you will taste a lot of stinky smells and tastes while swimming. \rThe snakes. If you don't like wild snakes - stay away from this hotel. We've seen 3 times snakes right near our room. I attach some photos.\rAnd finally you will be attacked with mosquitoes during all your stay there!\rDon't forget that there is nothing around the hotel in 15-20 minutes walk.", "p_comment": "The only thing I like there was a really great breakfast!"},
